## Notes

While building the app, the main challenges were ensuring correct DOM manipulation when filtering games and dynamically updating content without breaking existing elements. Debugging JavaScript errors and making sure data displayed correctly after each interaction also required careful attention.

I learned a lot about using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and how to structure my code for better readability and maintainability. I also gained experience in using ES6 features like arrow functions and template literals, which made my code cleaner and more efficient.
I would like to improve my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript and how to handle API calls more effectively. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques for styling and layout, as well as learning about frameworks like React or Vue.js for building dynamic web applications.
